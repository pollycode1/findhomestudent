#### Database Migration
```dart

  if (oldVersion < 2) {
    // Migration from version 1 to 2: Remove school, grade, classroom columns
    await db.execute('''
      CREATE TABLE students_new(
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        student_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        profile_image_path TEXT
      )
    ''');
    
    // Copy data from old table to new table
    await db.execute('''
      INSERT INTO students_new (id, name, student_id, profile_image_path)
      SELECT id, name, student_id, profile_image_path FROM students
    ''');
    
    // Drop old table and rename new table
    await db.execute('DROP TABLE students');
    await db.execute('ALTER TABLE students_new RENAME TO students');
  }
}
```

#### Updated Student Model
```dart
class Student {
  final int? id;
  final String name;
  final String studentId;
  final String? profileImagePath;
